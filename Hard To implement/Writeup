1. ECB known plaintext padding oracle is used
2. since it is ecp encryption, the key is repeated blockwise.
3. We get some encrypted string or when empty is sent.
4. We can reveal the encrypted text's a character by adding known characters behind. 
Like, 

0*15 + c + 0*15 
5. Since, each block is 16 bytes, we can try all 256 values for c and compare the first block with second.
6. After revealing the characters, we can keep replacing the 0's from 0*15 strings with known part of flags (the last block)
7. repeating this reveals the whole flag
